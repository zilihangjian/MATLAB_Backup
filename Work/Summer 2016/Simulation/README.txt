Quick Start Guide
- Run the GUI function in command line 
- Change the appropriate parameters in the GUI 
- Requirements to plot data:
	- selecting a data folder
	- verifying the string of the .mat file (The button next to the text entry to verify)
	- inputing the start and end value for the number of data points
	- selecting the algorithm for approximating the transmitter location
	- running the action by selecting the execute button
	
- Requirements to run a simulation:
	- set the appropriate parameters as above with the data plot
	- input the number of simulations to run
	- input the theoretical transmitter location
	- input the error percentage to introduce to the data
