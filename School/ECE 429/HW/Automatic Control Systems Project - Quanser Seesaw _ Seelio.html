on top. This was a design competition throughout the class, in which our group placed third.

This was performed as an end of class project for the Automatic Control Systems class at Purdue University. It was performed with the help of three group members. This class is an example of the root-locus design method using a lead-lag controller. 

Because this system was not similar to the ideal cases usually discussed in class problems, our group was able to experiment with various design methods and trial and error in order to balance the see-saw.</p></div><div class="work-skills"></div><div class="work-attachments"><ul><li><div class="attachment youtube"><iframe class="sAtt" src="./Automatic Control Systems Project - Quanser Seesaw _ Seelio_files/iJThhgAieHA.html" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></li><li><div class="attachment crocodoc" style="padding-bottom: 37px;"><iframe class="sAtt" src="./Automatic Control Systems Project - Quanser Seesaw _ Seelio_files/7f825915-8968-470f-962f-4b683d90ac40.html" frameborder="0"></iframe><div class="caption">Report
