% function [Vxy, Ex, Ey] = solve_laplace_2d_squaretubes(Vout, Vin, L1, L2, dx, TOL)
% 
% Solve Laplace's equation (EnM) for a 2D cartesian geometry for two square metal tubes
% that are "concentrically" placed (i.e. tube2 is symettrically located inside tube1)
% use the simultaneous over-relaxation technique (eqn 5.17) to calculate Vs
% The outer tube is held at a potential Vout
% The inner tube is held at a potential Vin
% L1 is the length of the outer tube
% L2 is the length of the inner tube (obviously L1 > L2)
% dx is the grid spacing (= dy)

% Vxy, a 2D matrix of the potential evaluated at all points made up by the % grid
