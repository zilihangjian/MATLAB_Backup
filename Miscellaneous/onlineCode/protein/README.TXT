%      solver.m
%      runcontest.m
%      testsuite.mat
%
%  The solver.m file is a sample submission for the contest.  It provides
%  a very simple solution, but illustrates how the input and output of your
%  entries should be formatted.  
%
%  The runcontest.m can be used to test your entry.  Once you have set up
%  your entry in the solver.m file, type 'runcontest' at the command
%  prompt.  The output is pretty rudimentary.  The first column gives the
%  score for each amino acid chain in the testsuite (found in
%  testsuite.mat), and the second column gives the time.  
%
%  If you would like to visualize your results, use runcontest(1).
%
%  Good luck, and have fun.
